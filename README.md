# Project Bluefish
## Description
During the height of the pandemic, a group of students ([Tim Nguyen](https://github.com/Piflyer), Vivian Nguyen, [Phineas Scovel](https://github.com/pitfall24)) sought out to design a virtual version of the Boston Latin School campus. Using Blender and secure WebXR techniques, the project helped connect students from all parts of Boston together.

## About this code
The models of the campus unfortunately cannot be released due to security reasons. However, this is the code for the secure viewer. Feel free to adapt this secure viewer for any webXR project you may have.
